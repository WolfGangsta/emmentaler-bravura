# emmentaler-bravura

A dictionary mapping Emmentaler glyphs to the SMuFL standard, using Bravura as a reference.

The release file (release/lily-to-smufl.json), generated from the main dictionary (lily-to-smufl.json) by generate-release.py, is meant to aid the generation of GNU Emmentaler by the LilyPond community.

NB: after generating, the file ought to be pretty-printed.
